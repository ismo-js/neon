## ~~[Ħ]~~ Project

(… written in *TypeScript*)

>   [*`(→)`* `^neon` Project Overview](../index.md)


## ~~[Ħ]~~ State

*Build-up phase:* not too much done yet; not runnable `:(`


## ~~[Ħ]~~ Introduction

*TypeScript* extends *EcmaScript* syntactically
 — by type definitions as well as future *ES* inspired sugar —
plus semantically
 — what can be seen in the emitted `*.d.ts`es.
*sounᴅ* plans to form a contrast …

##### *`(+)`* By:
+ Enabeling **run- *and* compile[*](#facit1)-time type** respectively descriptor **checking**

##### *`(-)`* Without:
- Extending the language **syntactic**ally
<br/>At compile-time, no changes were made to the sources[*](#facit1)

##### *`(=)`* Summing to:
* <span id="facit1">‹`*`›:</span>
The «compiler» is just a validating *Babel* plug-in, which uses the statically available information to perform type checks.

## ~~[Ħ]~~ Featueres

* Types
    + [Interface types](./types/inter.md)
    + [Class types](./types/class.md)
    + [Dynamic types](./types/dynam.md)

*<span id="foot1">‹`¹`›</span>*
>   Maybe — at a later point in time,
>   there will be a feature providing strong dynamical typing for `let`/`const` variables.
>
>   As I do not see proposals for things like *variable decorators* and *variable read/write hooks* on their ways,
>   therefore a policy change could occur.
