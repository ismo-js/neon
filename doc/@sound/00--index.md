Not too much done yet.


## :hash: Introduction

*TypeScript* extends *EcmaScript* syntactically
 — by type definitions as well as future *ES* inspired sugar —
plus semantically
 — what can be seen in the emitted `*.d.ts`es.
*sounᴅ* plans to form a contrast …

##### *`(+)`* By:
+ Enabeling **run- *and* compile[*](#facit1)-time type** respectively descriptor **checking**

##### *`(-)`* Without:
- Extending the language **syntactic**ally
<br/>At compile-time, no changes were made to the sources[*](#facit1)

##### *`(=)`* Summing to:
* <span id="facit1">‹`*`›:</span>
The «compiler» is just a validating *Babel* plug-in, which uses the statically available information to perform type checks.

## :hash: Featueres

* Types
    + [Interface types](./decorator-typing-concepts/types/inter.md)
    + [Class types](./decorator-typing-concepts/types/class.md)
    + [Dynamic types](./decorator-typing-concepts/types/dynam.md)

>   Maybe — at a later point in time,
>   there will be a feature providing strong dynamical typing for `let`/`const` variables.
>
>   As I do not see proposals for things like *variable decorators* and *variable read/write hooks* on their ways,
>   therefore a policy change could occur.
